<h2>Getting Familiar with Development Environment</h2>
<p>Start by log in the Linux server.</p>
<p>Windows User:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download putty. Go to the putty <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/download.html" target="_blank">download page</a>, and download putty.exe</li>
<li>Run putty.exe:</li>
<ul>
<li>fill in host name: syccuxas01.pcc.edu</li>
<li>fill in saved session name: any name you prefer, then click on save</li>
<li>click on open</li>
<li>you will see a prompt "login as: " Type in your login name which is the same as your mypcc login name followed by enter key press. At the prompt "Password: "&nbsp; type in the default password which is your PCC G number with capital G followed by enter key press. As you type, nothing will show for security reason. Just keep on typing.</li>
<li>change your passwd by typing "passwd" command.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Mac or Linux User:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>open the terminal window</p>
</li>
<li>type in command "ssh loginName@syccuxas01.pcc.edu" where loginName is your mypcc login name.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What this class is about?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This course is NOT about learning new C++ syntax. Instead, we will apply what we have learned in CS161 and CS162 to create new <strong>abstract data type</strong>.</p>
<p>Our goal this term:</p>
<ul>
<li>to learn different data structures</li>
<li>to learn algorithms to solve problems</li>
<li>to learn how to measure the efficiency of the approaches taken</li>
</ul>
<p>Data structure vs abstract data type:</p>
<ul>
<li>A data structure specifies how we store the data (e.g. an array, linked list).</li>
<li>An abstract data type (ADT) specifies how a new data type behaves: it includes the data and operations that the new data type requires.</li>
<li>ADT uses a data structure to store data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using classes to build ADTs:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will use the C++ class construct to build abstract data types</li>
<li>The data (represented by a data structure) are placed in the private section</li>
<li>The operations (what the "client" or application can invoke) are placed in the public section</li>
</ul>
<p>Seperation of ADT and clients who use ADT:</p>
<ul>
<li>The clients of ADT should not be aware of what data structure is being used (the private section of the class).
<ul>
<li>This means the client program should not be aware that there is a node or a next pointer for a linked list, or an index to an array.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This allows an ADT to "plug and play" different data structures, to maximize efficiency without disrupting the client program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some <em><strong>important</strong></em> implementation notes for this term:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>ADT implemented by class should not prompt, or read from the keyboard because the ADT doesn't know if there is anyone sitting at the keyboard. Instead have the client program do the prompt and read from the keyboard, then pass the data in the member functions of ADT.
<ul>
<li>An example:
<ul>
<li>a good design:<strong> add(const Data&amp; data)</strong>//read the data in the client program, then pass it in</li>
<li>a bad one: <strong>add()</strong> //prompt and read in data in add function</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You should only use statically allocated arrays for local variables. All arrays in the data section of ADT should be dynamically allocated.
<ul>
<li>An example:
<ul>
<li>use <strong>char * name; </strong>in data class so that the array contains exactly number of characters needed for name</li>
<li>use <strong>char name[MAX_LEN];</strong> where MAX_LEN is a constant integer as temporary storage because you don't know how big the name is yet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep your data members restricted to just what is necessary
<ul>
<li>For each data member, ask yourself the question "Could this be a local variable to a member function instead?"</li>
<li>If the value of the variable does not need to persist from operation to operation, it should NOT be a data member.</li>
<li>An example: Linked list implementation
<ul>
<li>head and tail are appropriate data members of the ADT because they are attributes of the list and their values need to be "remembered."</li>
<li>current and previous are NOT appropriate data members although they are used in almost every member function. They should be local variables of the member function because they don't describe the "state" of the list and their values don't need to be "remembered."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Last but not the least important note:
<ul>
<li>Think about efficiency this term!</li>
<li>Only traverse lists when absolutely necessary.</li>
<li>Use pass by reference to reduce the information from continually being copied when passing instances of a struct or a class. If you don't want the function to modify the object, use <strong>const Data&amp; data</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>What should I do for this module?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Get familiar with the linux programming environment</li>
<li>Also get familiar with Visual C++ programming environment for your own benefit, not for this class's requirement. Make sure you can create the hello project from scratch and add the two existing files to it.
<ul>
<li>The video "useVCPartI" introduces you to the Visual C++ development environment and how to make the project size manageable.</li>
<li>The video "useVCPartII" shows you how to add existing files to a project. I would start by creating a folder called CS260 somewhere handy on your hard drive, which over time will contain all of the projects you will work on this term.</li>
<li><a href="../sampleCode/mod1/hello.zip" target="_self">Here</a>&nbsp;is the zip file of the complete project for your reference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Review pointers and dynamic memory.
<ul>
<li>The video "reviewPtr" demonstrates the usage of pointer types and four operators, *, &amp; , new and delete. It also shows you the meaning of array name and [].</li>
<li>Watch out for the #1 cause of code crashing when using pointers! Are you trying to access memory that has not been allocated yet?</li>
<li><a href="/content/enforced/67886-21526.201302/module01files/../sampleCode/mod1/reviewPointer.zip">Here</a> is the zip file of the complete project for your reference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prepare the data type we are going to use throughout the term. Throughout the term we will design, implement and analyze various ways to organize data. Before we do that, we need to take care of our data objects so that we won't be distracted much when trying to organize them in different ways.
<ul>
<li>The video "dataPartI" shows you the ADT for data including the constructors, destructor, accessor member functions and mutator member functions. You might want to pay more attention about some new concepts such as initializer list, copy constructor, const parameter vs const member function.</li>
<li>The video "dataPartII" demonstrates the idea of operator overloading. The '=' operator overloading would save you tons of trouble later on when you use this data type. Watch out for another cause of code crashing, shallow copies!</li>
<li><a href="/content/enforced/67886-21526.201302/module01files/../sampleCode/mod1/data.zip">Here</a> is the zip file of the complete project for your reference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read and study the following chapters from the textbook:&nbsp; Data abstraction. Think about what walls mean and why you need to build them.</li>
<li>Now it is time for some hands on programming time. You need to start working on Project 1 as early as you can. It's definitely not a program you can complete in 2 hours even if you were an experienced programmer. I suggest you design and implement the data class for this week and work on the list class for next week. The videos about data should help you create the data class. It is essential that your coding style follows the <a href="/content/enforced/67886-21526.201302/module01files/../files/styleGuide.doc">style guidelines </a>for this class. Use of good style and good program design is a requirement for a good score on each assignment. In this class, form is of equal importance to function.</li>
<li>You need to complete lab1 for this week.</li>
<li>There is a practice quiz which will be available all term for you to take as many times as you like. It has nothing to do with CS260, but is available for you to learn how D2L handles quizzes in general, and to check that your computer, network, and browser are configured correctly to handle quizzes.</li>
</ul>
