To run the program, make sure the properly formatted "amount.txt" file is in the same folder/directory.
Enter "python ./change.py" into the command line.
The program will print some timing information and store the new data in a file called "change.txt" 
If "change.txt" already exists, the program will append the file, not overwrite it. 
Please delete "change.txt" in between trials for best results, unless you want to save all the trial data in the same file.
