Project 1

The server is multithreaded and does not provide chat function itself. To chat, open 2 clients. The server will respond
when messages are sent and pass them on to all clients. Only one message can be sent by a client at a time. When the 
message is sent any messages in the buffer will appear. 

To run the programs:
Place the files in a directory on the osu flip server
Build the c file. In bash type: make
Start the server in bash: python chat_server.py
In a new putty window, start the first client with the name "localhost" and the port number "9019". In bash: chater localhost 9019 
In another new putty window, start the second client with the same command. 
The clients will ask for a username. 
The server will display the messages to all clients.

Note: I did not have time to get the server running as well as I wanted, but it does function with multiple clients. With more time I could 
have made the program "prettier", but I feel it functions as required, and adds some extra functions with the multi thread.
