sends waypoints to robots
"look at map array for concentrations of -1's. 
create waypoint and find shortest path with A*
publish waypoint to robot. "

uses SLAM
"automatic"

exploration strategy
"find unexplored areas by searching out -1's and setting waypoint, ends when #% of array is not -1 BST?"

works dynamically
"A* is good. obstacle avoidance good"

find unexplored area
"find unexplored areas by searching out -1's and setting waypoint, ends when #% of array is not -1 BST?"

waypoint fail
"ignore area and search for next waypoint"

exploration algorithm
"A*"

works on all worlds
"redundancy"
